# weather-dashboard

## Description

A weather dashboard app designed to further my knowledge and understanding as a developer in integrating third-party web APIs. The weather dashboard or 'weather report' will have live updates to the weather. It will also allow the user to search for a specific city, access the web API "5 day weather forecast" to retrieve live weather updates and then feature previously searched cities and their weather status. Additionally it will display the upcoming 5 day weather forecast for the current selected city.

## Installation

For the purposes of this project, the web application will be hosted on GitHub Pages (https://tranthom618.github.io/weather-dashboard/)


## Usage

![Preview of navigation links](assets/images/readme-instructional.png?raw=true "README Example")

The only user interactability will be on the left-hand side, showcasing a search bar & button, as well as buttons to view other cities quickly. The weather information will be the main splash displayed.
